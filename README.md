# Remarkable
Remarkable Template

Example code to create some geometric templates for the Remarkable Tablet.
Generally the supplied tmeplates are only large grids so i wanted somthing a little smaller.

So added:

* Square grid
* Right grid
* triangle grid
* Hexagon grid

The format is a transprent png approximatly 1404 x 1872 pixels.
The process I have chosen is to initially generate the grids as svg's and then save this as png's.
